You want to create a mobile app for your clientele to track their workouts, nutrient macros, and calories, and to schedule appointments with you. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Workout Tracking:** A screen where clients can log their workouts, including exercises, sets, reps, and weight.\n*   **Nutrition Tracking:** A section for clients to input their daily food intake, track nutrient macros (protein, carbs, fat), and count calories.\n*   **Appointment Scheduling:** An interface where clients can view your availability and book appointments.\n*   **Profile Screen:** A screen where clients can view their profile.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#64b5f6` (Light blue for main interactive elements)\n    *   Secondary: `#aed581` (Light green for accents and success indicators)\n    *   Accent: `#ffb74d` (Amber for highlights and calls to action)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#ffee58` (Yellow for important notifications or selections)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" (default for the platform) or \"Roboto\" for Android, with a focus on readability.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create Workout Tracking Screen:** Create a new screen in the `app/(tabs)` directory for workout tracking. This screen should allow users to input exercises, sets, reps, and weight.\n2.  **Create Nutrition Tracking Screen:** Create a new screen in the `app/(tabs)` directory for nutrition tracking. This screen should allow users to input their daily food intake and track macros and calories.\n3.  **Create Appointment Scheduling Screen:** Create a new screen in the `app/(tabs)` directory for appointment scheduling. This screen should display your availability and allow clients to book appointments.\n4.  **Modify the Tab Layout:** Modify the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file to include the new workout, nutrition, and appointment screens in the tab bar. Use appropriate icons for each tab.\n5.  **Remove Modal Demos:** Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it is not needed for the app's core functionality.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement this plan and modify the `app/(tabs)` folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user. After the coding agent is done, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-03T22:54:52.182561"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll create a comprehensive fitness tracking app for your clients with workout tracking, nutrition tracking, calorie counter, and appointment scheduling.
